How to use this Makefile

To build the project just type

$ make

To run the application use the matrix dataset from /home/lect0012/matrix or download it from 

http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/MM/AMD/G3_circuit.tar.gz

$ wget http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/MM/AMD/G3_circuit.tar.gz

unpack the tar ball

$ tar xzf G3_circuit.tar.gz

and then run (default matrix directory is set to /home/lect0012/matrix)

$ make run

The equation system using the G3_circuit matrix needs about 5009 iterations to converge in the serial case. Please note that this can differ on the GPU or even on the CPU using OpenMP. 

To build the application with debug information type

$ make clean
$ make dbg=1

You can run the debug version which uses the small example debug.mtx:

$ make run_debug

Every step of the algorithm will be printed out and the results can be compared step by step with the provided document (Appendix A).

To compile for CUDA rename all c-files containing CUDA code (probably only solver.c) to *.cu (e.g. solver.cu) and use:

$ module switch intel gcc
$ module load cuda
$ make clean
$ make cuda

To use the OpenACC compiler use:

$ module switch gcc pgi (or module switch intel pgi, depending on the compiler that was loaded)
$ make openacc

IMPORTANT: We already prepared the targets run and run_serena. Specify all needed parameters here. For the evaluation we will just execute the run target to do the measurements.

Feel free to modify the Makefile!
